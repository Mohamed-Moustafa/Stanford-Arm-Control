1- Coriolios.m                                                ---> is function to calculate coriolios term

2- Rx.m Ry.m .... Tx.m Ty.m etc                               ---> is Rotation & Translation functions that help me define forward Kinematics

3- RRP.mlx                                                    ---> is live script that i used to establish my system dynamics

4- Regressor.m                                                ---> is script to establish regressor and help me to test if it crosspond to our system our not

5- Stanfor-Arm.ipynb                                          ---> is the python file work that i done includes everything till final output of simulations
